# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
In week zero, we were introduced to the cloud bootcamp program. Our projecte was to build a CRUD application similar to twitter 'CRUDDR' which would entail cloning the blank repository and adding components to it.
We were introduced to some of our indtructors who took us through things like AWS spend considerations, security considerations and conceptual diamgrams.
We were also introduced to the CRUDDR app and given a use case of the intending customer and looked at the tradeoffs of using certain components and the importance of planning and visualising the application before building it.
We were then asked to build a logical CRUD diagram of which i designed a simple serverless CRUD diagram.
The link to the diagram is : https://lucid.app/lucidchart/ecb87406-333e-455b-96fc-985a56d79929/edit?viewport_loc=280%2C41%2C1707%2C821%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_586f272c-d835-45cc-8c3d-e5eb3b9c004a
